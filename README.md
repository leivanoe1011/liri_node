1. The Node Console application is presented with 4 functionalities.  Ultimately, all 4 functions must provide a communication method and parse a response. The goal is to receive a command from the user and provide details about the subject. 

2. At a high level the application will receive a command from the user and the data is trying to capture. Next, it will provide the details of the subject the user is trying to get more information about. 
  
3. To begin, the user must take a copy of the project to their local machine.  Below I provide the GitHub repository link. 
Next, the user must type a command.  Below is a list of commands that will be available. 
- node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
- node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
- node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
- node liri.js do-what-it-says
Once the user picks one of the commands above, they will be provided with a preview of the results received from the various APIs. 
At the same time, the app will create an entry in the log.txt file that the user may view at anytime where the results are also displayed from their commands.

6. The application made good use Node JS and different API communication methods. 
Such API communication methods used were AXIOS and Spotify API.  Using AXIOS NPM library we communicated with "bandsintown" API and "omdbapi" API. 

7. In this project I was the architect and developer of the application.
